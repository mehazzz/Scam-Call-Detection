# Scam-Call-Detection
📞 Scam Call Detection using Machine Learning
This project uses multiple datasets from Hugging Face to train three machine learning models — Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest — to detect scam conversations. It includes preprocessing logic to normalize differently structured datasets and evaluate model performance on a separate test dataset. All the code, including training, testing, and visualization, is contained in a single notebook.

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn datasets joblib
⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook or use any environment like VS Code or Google Colab, and open:

Training_and_Testing.ipynb
2. Run All Cells
The notebook will:
Load and combine multiple scam-related datasets from Hugging Face.
Preprocess and normalize them into a unified format.
Train three models: Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest.
Evaluate them on a clean, balanced test dataset (balanced_dataset.csv).
Generate confusion matrices and ROC curves for all models.
Save the models and plots to their respective directories.
🧠 Models Used
Naive Bayes: A fast probabilistic classifier suitable for text.
SVM: Excellent generalization for high-dimensional data like TF-IDF vectors.
Random Forest: A robust ensemble model that prevents overfitting.
📊 Results Snapshot
Model	Validation Accuracy	Test Accuracy
Naive Bayes	~95.6%	~72.0%
SVM	~98.5%	~95.2%
Random Forest	~98.3%	~95.4%
📎 Notes
The notebook handles datasets with varying schemas and label formats.
Unified schema: All datasets are transformed to use text and label columns where label is either 0 (Not Scam) or 1 (Scam).
A separate, balanced dataset (balanced_dataset.csv) is used for evaluation to avoid data leakage.
Plots for each model are exported as .png files to the plots/ directory.
